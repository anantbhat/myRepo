                  <P></P>
                  <H2>1. What does the Orientation property do in a Menu 
                  control?</H2>
                  <P>Orientation property of the Menu control sets the display 
                  of menu on a Web page 										to vertical or horizontal.
                  										 <BR>										Originally the orientation is set to 
                  vertical.</P>
                  <H2>2. Differentiate between:</H2>
                  <H2>a.)Client-side and server-side validations in Web 
                  pages.</H2>
                  <P>- Client-side validations happends at the client's side 
                  with the help of 										JavaScript and VBScript. This 
                  happens before the Web page is sent to the 										server.
                  										 <BR>										- Server-side validations occurs 
                  place at the server side.</P>
                  <H2>b.)Authentication and authorization.									 </H2>
                  <P>- Authentication is the process of verifyng the identity of 
                  a user using some 										credentials like username and 
                  password while authorization determines the parts 										of 
                  the system to which a particular identity has access.
                  										 <BR>										- Authentication is required before 
                  authorization.										 <BR><BR>										For e.g. If an 
                  employee authenticates himself with his credentials on a 
                  system, 										authorization will determine if he has the 
                  control over just publishing the 										content or also 
                  editing it.</P><SPAN id="Span171"><SPAN class="paratitle1" id="Span173">
                  <H2>3.a.) What does the .WebPart file do?</H2>
                  <P>It explains the settings of a Web Parts control that can be 
                  included to a 												specified zone on a Web page.</P>
                  <H2>b.) How would you enable impersonation in the web.config 
                  file?</H2>
                  <P>In order to enable the impersonation in the web.confing 
                  file, take the following 												steps:												 <BR>
                  												- Include the &lt;identity&gt; element in the 
                  web.config file.												 <BR>												- Set the 
                  impersonate attribute to true as shown below:<BR>
                  												&lt;identity impersonate = "true" /&gt;</P>
                  <H2>4. a.) Differentiate between											 </H2>
                  <H2>a.)File-based dependency and key-based dependency.</H2>
                  <P>- In file-based dependency, the dependency is on a file 
                  saved in a disk while in 												key-based dependency, you 
                  depend on another cached item.</P>
                  <H2>b.) Globalization and localization.</H2>
                  <P>- Globalization is a technique to identify the part of a 
                  Web application that is 												different for different 
                  languages and separate it out from the web application 
                  												while in localization you try to configure a Web 
                  application so that it can be 												supported for a 
                  specific language or locale.</P>
                  <H2>5. a.)Differentiate between a page theme and a global 
                  theme?</H2>
                  <P>- Page theme applies to a particular web pages of the 
                  project. It is stored 												inside a subfolder of the 
                  App_Themes folder.												 <BR>												- Global theme 
                  applies to all the web applications on the web server. It is 
                  												stored inside the Themes folder on a Web server.
                  											 </P>
                  <H2>b.)What are Web server controls in ASP.NET?</H2>
                  <P>- These are the objects on ASP.NET pages that run when the 
                  Web page is 												requested.												 <BR>
                  												- Some of these Web server controls, like button 
                  and text box, are similar to 												the HTML controls.
                  												 <BR>												- Some controls exhibit complex 
                  behavior like the controls used to connect to 												data 
                  sources and display data.</P>
                  <H2>6. a.) Differentiate between a HyperLink control and a 
                  LinkButton control.											 </H2>
                  <P>- A HyperLink control does not have the Click and Command 
                  events while the 												LinkButton control has them, 
                  which can be handled in the code-behind file of 
                  												the Web page.</P>
                  <H2>b.) How do Cookies work? Give an example of their 
                  abuse.</H2>
                  <P>- The server directs the browser to put some files in a 
                  cookie. All the cookies 												are then sent for the 
                  domain in each request.												 <BR>												- An 
                  example of cookie abuse could be a case where a large cookie 
                  is stored 												affecting the network traffic.</P>
                  <H2>7. a.) What are Custom User Controls in ASP.NET?</H2>
                  <P>- These are the controls defined by developers and work 
                  similart to other web 												server controls.<BR>
                  												- They are a mixture of custom behavior and 
                  predefined behavior.											 </P>
                  <H2>b.) What is Role-based security?</H2>
                  <P>- Used in almost all organization, the Role-based security 
                  assign certain 												privileges to each role.
                  												 <BR>												- Each user is assigned a 
                  particular role from the list.												 <BR>												- 
                  Privileges as per role restrict the user's actions on the 
                  system and ensure 												that a user is able to do only 
                  what he is permitted to do on the system.											 </P>
                  <H2>8. What are the HTML server controls in ASP.NET?</H2>
                  <P>- HTML server controls are similar to the standard HTML 
                  elements like those used 												in HTML pages.
                  												 <BR>												- They expose properties and 
                  events for programatical use.												 <BR>												- To 
                  make these controls programmatically accessible, we specify 
                  that the HTML 												controls act as a server control by 
                  adding the runat="server" attribute.</P>
                  <H2>9. a.) What are the various types of Cookies in 
                  ASP.NET?</H2>
                  <P>There exist two types of cookies in ASP.NET<BR><BR>
                  												- Session Cookie - It resides on the machine of 
                  the client for a single session 												and works until 
                  the user logs out of the session.												 <BR>
                  												- Persistent Cookie - It resides on the machine of 
                  a user for a specified 												period. This period can be 
                  set up manually by the user.</P>
                  <H2>b.) How would you turn off cookies on one page of your 
                  website?											 </H2>
                  <P>- This can be done by using the Cookie.Discard property.
                  												 <BR>												- It Gets or sets the discard 
                  flag set by the server.												 <BR>												- When set 
                  to true, this property instructs the client application not to 
                  save 												the Cookie on the hard disk of the user at 
                  the end of the session.											 </P>
                  <H2>c.) How would you create a permanent cookie?
                  											 </H2>
                  <P>- Permanent cookies are stored on the hard disk and are 
                  available until a 												specified expiration date is 
                  reached.												 <BR>												- To create a cookie that 
                  never expires set its Expires property equal to 
                  												DateTime.maxValue.											 </P>
                  <H2>10. a.) Explain Culture and UICulture values.</H2>
                  <P>- Culture value determines the functions like Date and 
                  Currency used to format 												data and numbers in a Web 
                  page.												 <BR>												- UICulture value determines 
                  the resources like strings or images loaded in a 
                  												Web application for a Web page.</P>
                  <H2>b.) What is Global.asax file used for?</H2>

                  <P>- Web Forms are an extremely important part of ASP.NET.
                  												 <BR>												- They are the User Interface 
                  (UI) elements which provide the desired look and 
                  												feel to your web applications.												 <BR>
                  												- Web Forms provide properties, methods, and 
                  events for the controls that are 												placed onto them.
                  											 </P>
                  <H2>b.) What is event bubbling?</H2>
                  <P>- When child control send events to parent it is termed as 
                  event bubbling.												 <BR>												- Server controls 
                  like Data grid, Data List, and Repeater can have other child 
                  												controls inside them.											 </P>
                  <H2>12. What are the various types of validation controls 
                  provided by ASP.NET?</H2>
                  <P>ASP.NET provides 6 types of validation controls as listed 
                  below:<BR><BR>												i.) RequiredFieldValidator - It is 
                  used when you do not want the container to 												be 
                  empty. It checks if the control has any value or not.
                  												 <BR><BR>												ii.) RangeValidator - It 
                  checks if the value in validated control is within the 
                  												specified range or not.												 <BR><BR>
                  												iii.) CompareValidator - Checks if the value in 
                  controls matches some specific 												values or not.
                  												 <BR><BR>												iv.) 
                  RegularExpressionValidator - Checks if the value matches a 
                  specific 												regular expression or not.<BR><BR>
                  												v.) CustomValidator - Used to define User Defined 
                  validation.<BR><BR>												vi.) Validation Summary 
                  -Displays summary of all current validation errors on 
                  												an ASP.NET page.</P>

                  <H2>a.) Namespace and Assembly.											 </H2>
                  <P>- Namespace is a naming convenience for logical design-time 
                  while an assembly 												establishes the name scope for 
                  types at run time.											 </P>
                  <H2>b.) Early binding and late binding.											 </H2>
                  <P>Early binding means calling a non-virtual method that is 
                  decided at a compile 												time while Late binding 
                  refers to calling a virtual method that is decided at a 
                  												runtime.</P>
                  <H2>14. What are the different kinds of assemblies?</H2>
                  <P>There can be two types of assemblies.												 <BR><BR>
                  												i.) Static assemblies -												 <BR><BR>
                  												- They are stored on disk in portable executable 
                  files.												 <BR>												- It includes .NET 
                  Framework types like interfaces and classes, resources for 
                  												the assembly (bitmaps, JPEG files, resource files 
                  etc.).<BR><BR>												ii.) Dynamic assemblies -
                  												 <BR><BR>												- They are not saved on disk 
                  before execution rather they run directly from 
                  												memory.												 <BR>												- They can be 
                  saved to disk after they have been executed.											 </P>
                  <H2>15. Differentiate between Structure and Class.
                  											 </H2>
                  <P>- Structures are value type while Classes are reference 
                  type.<BR>												- Structures can not have constructor or 
                  destructors while Classes can have 												them.
                  												 <BR>												- Structures do not support 
                  Inheritance while Classes do support Inheritance.

                  <H2>16. Explain ViewState.											 </H2>
                  <P>- It is a .Net mechanism to store the posted data among 
                  post backs.<BR>												- It allows the state of objects to 
                  be stored in a hidden field on the page, 												saved on 
                  client side and transported back to server whenever required.

                  											 </H2>
                  <P>There are 3 types of Authentication namely Windows, Forms 
                  and Passport 												Authentication.<BR><BR>												- 
                  Windows authentication - It uses the security features 
                  integrated in Windows 												NT and Windows XP OS to 
                  authenticate and authorize Web application users.<BR><BR>
                  												- Forms authentication - It allows you to create 
                  your own list of users and 												validate their identity 
                  when they visit the Web site.<BR><BR>												- Passport 
                  authentication - It uses the Microsoft centralized 
                  authentication 												provider to identify users. 
                  Passport allows users to use a single identity 
                  												across multiple Web applications. Passport SDK 
                  needs to be installed to use 												Passport 
                  authentication in your Web application.											 </P>
                  <H2>18. Explain Server-side scripting and Client-side 
                  scripting.											 </H2>
                  <P>- Server side scripting - All the script are executed by 
                  the server and 												interpreted as needed.
                  												 <BR>												- Client side scripting means 
                  that the script will be executed immediately in 
                  												the browser such as form field validation, email 
                  validation, etc. It is 												usaullay carrried out in 
                  VBScript or JavaScript.											 </P>
                  <H2>19. a.) What is garbage collection?											 </H2>
                  <P>It is a system where a run-time component takes 
                  responsibility for managing the 												lifetime of 
                  objects and the heap memory that they occupy.											 </P>
                  <H2>b.) Explain serialization and deserialization.
                  											 </H2>
                  <P>- Serialization is the process of converting an object into 
                  a stream of bytes.<BR>												- Deserialization is the 
                  process of creating an object from a stream of bytes.
                  												 <BR><BR>												Both these processes are 
                  usually used to transport objects.</P>
                  <H2>20. What are the various session state management options 
                  provided by ASP.NET?											 </H2>
                  <P>- ASP.NET provides two session state management options - 
                  In-Process and 												Out-of-Process state management.
                  												 <BR>												- In-Process stores the session 
                  in memory on the web server.												 <BR>												- 
                  Out-of-Process stores data in an external data source. This 
                  data source may 												be a SQL Server or a State Server 
                  service. Out-of-Process state management 												needs all 
                  objects stored in session to be serializable.											 </P>

                  available, 												ASP.NET directs the user to a Passport 
                  sign-on page. The Passport service 												authenticates 
                  the user, stores an authentication cookie on the user’s

                  <H2 id="four">What is caching?</H2>
                  <P>Caching is the technique of storing frequently used items 
                  in memory so that they 												can be accessed more 
                  quickly.												 <BR>												By caching the response, 
                  the request is served from the response already stored 
                  												in memory.												 <BR>												It’s 
                  important to choose the items to cache wisely as Caching 
                  incurs overhead.												 <BR>												A Web form that 
                  is frequently used and does not contain data that frequently 
                  												changes is good for caching.												 <BR>
                  												A cached web form freezes form’s server-side

                  <P><STRONG>Answer:</STRONG><BR><BR>												A web 
                  application resides in the server and serves the client's 
                  requests over 												internet. The client access the web 
                  page using browser from his machine. When a 												client 
                  makes a request, it receives the result in the form of HTML 
                  which are 												interpreted and displayed by the

                  the request received from 												client to the 
                  application. The application returns the requested result in 
                  the 												form of HTML to IIS, which in turn, sends the

                  separated which reduces the inconveniences of 
                  												program maintenance.<BR><BR>												ASP.NET 
                  makes for easy deployment. There is no need to register 
                  components 												because the configuration information 
                  is built-in.<BR><BR>												To develop program logic, a

                  <P>.NET Framework provides platform for developing windows and 
                  web software. 												ASP.NET is a part of .Net framework 
                  and can access all features implemented 												within it 
                  that was formerly available only through windows API. .NET 
                  Framework 												sits in between our application programs

                  <H2>7. What is an Assembly? Explain its parts</H2>
                  <P><STRONG>Answer:</STRONG></P>
                  <P>An assembly exists as a .DLL or .EXE that contains MSIL 
                  code that is executed by 												CLR. An assembly contains 
                  interface and classes, it can also contain other 
                  												resources like bitmaps, files etc. It carries 
                  version details which are used by 												the CLR during 
                  execution. Two assemblies of the same name but with different 
                  												versions can run side-by-side enabling 
                  applications that depend on a specific 												version to 
                  use assembly of that version. An assembly is the unit on which 
                  												permissions are granted. It can be private or 
                  global. A private assembly is 												used only by the 
                  application to which it belongs, but the global assembly can 
                  												be used by any application in the system.<BR><BR>
                  												The four parts of an assembly are:<BR><BR>
                  												Assembly Manifest - It contains name, version, 
                  culture, and information about 												referenced 
                  assemblies.<BR><BR>												Type metadata - It contains 
                  information about types defined in the assembly.<BR><BR>
                  												MSIL - MSIL code.<BR><BR>												Resources - 
                  Files such as BMP or JPG file or any other files required by 
                  												application.</P>

                  <P><STRONG>Answer:</STRONG></P>
                  <P>.Net allows developers to write program logic in at least 
                  25 languages. The 												classes written in one language 
                  can be used by other languages in .Net. This 
                  												service of .Net is possible through CTS which 
                  ensure the rules related to data 												types that all 
                  language must follow. It provides set of types that are used 
                  by 												all .NET languages and ensures .NET language

                  Application</H2>
                  <P><STRONG>Answer:</STRONG></P>
                  <P>A web application starts when a browser requests a page of 
                  the application first 												time. The request is 
                  received by the IIS which then starts ASP.NET worker 
                  												process (aspnet_wp.exe). The worker process then 
                  allocates a process space to 												the assembly and 
                  loads it. An application_start event occurs followed by 
                  												Session_start. The request is then processed by 
                  the ASP.NET engine and sends 												back response in the 
                  form of HTML. The user receives the response in the form 
                  												of page.<BR><BR>												The page can be 
                  submitted to the server for further processing. The page 
                  												submitting triggers postback event that causes the 
                  browser to send the page 												data, also called as view 
                  state to the server. When server receives view state, 
                  												it creates new instance of the web form. The data 
                  is then restored from the 												view state to the 
                  control of the web form in Page_Init event.<BR><BR>
                  												The data in the control is then available in the 
                  Page_load event of the web 												form. The cached event 
                  is then handled and finally the event that caused the 
                  												postback is processed. The web form is then 
                  destroyed. When the user stops 												using the 
                  application, Session_end event occurs and session ends. The 
                  default 												session time is 20 minutes. The 
                  application ends when no user accessing the 
                  												application and this triggers Application_End 
                  event. Finally all the resources 												of the 
                  application are reclaimed by the Garbage collector.</P>

                  ASP.NET?</H2>
                  <P><STRONG>Answer:</STRONG><BR><BR>												ASP.NET has 
                  introduced view state to preserve data between postback 
                  events. 												View state can't avail data to other web 
                  form in an application. To provide 												data to other 
                  forms, you need to save data in a state variable in the 
                  												application or session objects.</P>
                  <H2>12. Define application state variable and session state 
                  variable.</H2>
                  <P><STRONG>Answer:</STRONG></P>
                  <P>These objects provide two levels of scope:<BR><BR>
                  												Application State<BR>												Data stored in 
                  the application object can be shared by all the sessions of 
                  the 												application. Application object stores data in 
                  the key value pair.<BR><BR>												Session State<BR>
                  												Session State stores session-specific information 
                  and the information is 												visible within the session 
                  only. ASP.NET creates unique sessionId for each 
                  												session of the application. SessionIDs are 
                  maintained either by an HTTP cookie 												or a modified 
                  URL, as set in the application’s configuration settings. By 
                  												default, SessionID values are stored in a 
                  cookie.</P>

                  <P>Answer:<BR><BR>												ASP.NET offers many server 
                  controls like button, textbox, DropDownList etc. 
                  												Each control can respond to the user's actions

                  <H2>17. Describe how ASP.NET maintains process isolation for 
                  each Web application</H2>
                  <P>Answer:</P>
                  <P>In ASP.NET, when IIS receives a request, IIS uses 
                  aspnet_isapi.dll to call the 												ASP.NET worker 
                  process (aspnet_wp.exe). The ASP.NET worker process loads the 
                  												Web application's assembly, allocating one process 
                  space, called the 												application domain, for each 
                  application. This is the how ASP.NET maintains 
                  												process isolation for each Web application.</P>
                  <H2>18. Define namespace.</H2>
                  <P>Answer:</P>
                  <P>Namespaces are the way to organize programming code. It 
                  removes the chances of 												name conflict. It is quite 
                  possible to have one name for an item accidentally 
                  												in large projects those results into conflict. By 
                  organizing your code into 												namespaces, you reduce 
                  the chance of these conflicts. You can create namespaces 
                  												by enclosing a class in a Namespace...End 
                  Namespace block.<BR><BR>												You can use namespaces 
                  outside your project by referring them using References 
                  												dialog box. You can use Imports or using statement 
                  to the code file to access 												members of the 
                  namespaces in code.</P>
                  <H2>19. What are the options in ASP.NET to maintain 
state?</H2>
                  <P>Answer:</P>
                  <P>Client-side state management<BR>												This maintains 
                  information on the client’s machine using Cookies, View State, 
                  												and Query Strings.<BR><BR>												Cookies<BR>
                  												A cookie is a small text file on the client 
                  machine either in the client’s file 												system or 
                  memory of client browser session. Cookies are not good for 
                  sensitive 												data. Moreover, Cookies can be disabled 
                  on the browser. Thus, you can’t rely on 												cookies 
                  for state management.<BR><BR>												View State<BR>
                  												Each page and each control on the page has View 
                  State property. This property 												allows automatic 
                  retention of page and controls state between each trip to 
                  												server. This means control value is maintained 
                  between page postbacks. 												Viewstate is implemented 
                  using _VIEWSTATE, a hidden form field which gets 
                  												created automatically on each page. You can’t 
                  transmit data to other page using 												view 
                  state.<BR><BR>												Querystring<BR>												Query 
                  strings can maintain limited state information. Data can be 
                  passed from 												one page to another with the URL but 
                  you can send limited size of data with the 												URL. 
                  Most browsers allow a limit of 255 characters on URL 
                  length.<BR><BR>												Server-side state management<BR>
                  												This kind of mechanism retains state in the 
                  server.<BR><BR>												Application State<BR>
                  												The data stored in the application object can be 
                  shared by all the sessions of 												the application. 
                  Application object stores data in the key value pair.<BR><BR>
                  												Session State<BR>												Session State stores 
                  session-specific information and the information is 
                  												visible within the session only. ASP.NET creates 
                  unique sessionId for each 												session of the 
                  application. SessionIDs are maintained either by an HTTP 
                  cookie 												or a modified URL, as set in the 
                  application’s configuration settings. By 												default, 
                  SessionID values are stored in a cookie.<BR><BR>
                  												Database<BR>												Database can be used to 
                  store large state information. Database support is used 
                  												in combination with cookies or session state.</P>

                  <H2>26. Define caching.</H2>
                  <P>Answer:</P>
                  <P>Caching is the technique of storing frequently used items 
                  in memory so that they 												can be accessed more 
                  quickly. Caching technique allows to store/cache page 
                  												output or application data on the client on the 
                  server. The cached information 												is used to serve 
                  subsequent requests that avoid the overhead of recreating the 
                  												same information. This enhances performance when 
                  same information is requested 												many times by the 
                  user.</P>

                  <H2>28. What is delegate?</H2>
                  <P>Answer:</P>
                  <P>A delegate acts like a strongly type function pointer. 
                  Delegates can invoke the 												methods that they 
                  reference without making explicit calls to those methods. It 
                  												is type safe since it holds reference of only 
                  those methods that match its 												signature. Unlike 
                  other classes, the delegate class has a signature. Delegates 
                  												are used to implement event programming model in 
                  .NET application. Delegates 												enable the methods 
                  that listen for an event, to be abstract.</P>
                  <H2>29. Explain Exception handling in .Net.</H2>
                  <P>Answer:<BR>												Exceptions or errors are unusual 
                  occurrences that happen within the logic of an 
                  												application. The CLR has provided structured way 
                  to deal with exceptions using 												Try/Catch block. 
                  ASP.NET supports some facilities to handling exceptions using 
                  												events suck as Page_Error and 
                  Application_Error.</P>
                  <H2>30. What is impersonation?</H2>
                  <P>Answer:</P>
                  <P>Impersonation means delegating one user identity to another 
                  user. In ASP.NET, 												the anonymous users impersonate 
                  the ASPNET user account by default. You can use 
                  												&lt;identity&gt; element of web.config file to 
                  impersonate user. E.g. 												&lt;identity 
                  impersonate="true"/&gt;</P>
                  <H2>31. What is managed code in .Net?</H2>
                  <P>Answer:</P>
                  <P>The code that runs under the guidance of common language 
                  runtime (CLR) is called 												managed code. The 
                  versioning and registration problem which are formally 
                  												handled by the windows programming are solved in 
                  .Net with the introduction of 												managed code. The 
                  managed code contains all the versioning and type information 
                  												that the CLR use to run the application.</P>
                  <H2>32. What are Merge modules?</H2>
                  <P>Answer:</P>
                  <P>Merge modules are the deployment projects for the shared 
                  components. If the 												components are already 
                  installed, the modules merge the changes rather than 
                  												unnecessarily overwrite them. When the components 
                  are no longer in use, they 												are removed safely from 
                  the server using Merge modules facility.</P>
                  <H2>33. What is Satellite assembly?</H2>

                  <H2>34. Define secured sockets layer.</H2>
                  <P>Answer:</P>
                  <P>Secured Socket Layer (SSL) ensures a secured web 
                  application by encrypting the 												data sent over 
                  internet. When an application is using SSL facility, the 
                  server 												generates an encryption key for the session 
                  and page is encrypted before it 												sent. The client 
                  browse uses this encryption key to decrypt the requested Web 
                  												page.</P>
                  <H2>35. Define session in ASP.NET.</H2>
                  <P>Answer:</P>
                  <P>A session starts when the browser first request a resources 
                  from within the 												application. The session gets 
                  terminated when either browser closed down or 
                  												session time out has been attained. The default 
                  time out for the session is 20 												minutes.</P>
                  <H2>36. Define Tracing.</H2>
                  <P>Answer:</P>
                  <P>Tracing is the way to maintain events in an application. It 
                  is useful while the 												application is in debugging or 
                  in the testing phase. The trace class in the 												code 
                  is used to diagnose problem. You can use trace messages to 
                  your project to 												monitor events in the released 
                  version of the application. The trace class is 
                  												found in the System.Diagnostics namespace. ASP.NET 
                  introduces tracing that 												enables you to write debug 
                  statements in your code, which still remain in the 
                  												code even after when it is deployed to production 
                  servers.</P>
                  <H2>37. Define View State.</H2>
                  <P>Answer:</P>
                  <P>ASP.NET preserves data between postback events using view 
                  state. You can save a 												lot of coding using view 
                  state in the web form. ViewState serialize the state 
                  												of objects and store in a hidden field on the 
                  page. It retains the state of 												server-side objects 
                  between postbacks. It represents the status of the page 
                  												when submitted to the server. By default, view 
                  state is maintained for each 												page. If you do not 
                  want to maintain the ViewState, include the directive 
                  												&lt;%@ Page EnableViewState="false" %&gt; at the 
                  top of an .aspx page or add 												the attribute 
                  EnableViewState="false" to any control. ViewState exist for 
                  the 												life of the current page.</P>
                  <H2>38. What is application domain?</H2>
                  <P>Answer:</P>
                  <P>It is the process space within which ASP.NET application 
                  runs. Every application 												has its own process space 
                  which isolates it from other application. If one of 
                  												the application domains throws error it does not 
                  affect the other application 												domains.</P>

                  languages' executable 												exists as MSIL which gets 
                  converted into machine specific language using JIT 
                  												compiler just before execution.</P>
                  <H2>42. Response.Redirect vs Server.Transfer</H2>
                  <P>Answer:</P>
                  <P>Server.Transfer is only applicable for aspx files. It 
                  transfers page processing 												to another page without 
                  making round-trip back to the client's browser. Since 
                  												no round trips, it offers faster response and 
                  doesn't update client url history 												list.<BR><BR>
                  												Response.Redirect is used to redirect to another 
                  page or site. This performs a 												trip back to the 
                  client where the client’s browser is redirected to the new 
                  												page.</P>
                  <H2>43. Explain Session state management options in 
                  ASP.NET.</H2>
                  <P>Answer:</P>
                  <P>ASP.NET provides In-Process and Out-of-Process state 
                  management. In-Process 												stores the session in 
                  memory on the web server. Out-of-Process Session state 
                  												management stores data in an external data source 
                  such as SQL Server or a State 												Server service. 
                  Out-of-Process state management requires that all objects 
                  												stored in session are serializable.</P>

                  <H2>57. What is reflection?</H2>
                  <P>Answer:</P>
                  <P>Reflection is a mechanism through which types defined in 
                  the metadata of each 												module can be accessed. The 
                  System.Reflection namespaces contains classes that 
                  												can be used to define the types for an 
                  assembly.</P>
                  <H2>58. Define Satellite Assemblies.</H2>
                  <P>Answer:</P>
                  <P>Satellite Assemblies are the special kinds of assemblies 
                  that exist as DLL and 												contain culturespecific 
                  resources in a binary format. They store compiled 
                  												localized application resources. They can be 
                  created using the AL utility and 												can be deployed 
                  even after deployment of the application. Satellite Assemblies 
                  												encapsulate resources into binary format and thus 
                  makes resources lighter and 												consume lesser space 
                  on the disk.</P>
                  <H2>59. What is CAS?</H2>
                  <P>Answer:</P>
                  <P>CAS is very important part of .Net security system which 
                  verifies if particular 												piece of code is allowed to 
                  run. It also determines if piece of code have 
                  												access rights to run particular resource. .NET 
                  security system applies these 												features using code 
                  groups and permissions. Each assembly of an application is 
                  												the part of code group with associated 
                  permissions.</P>
                  <H2>60. Explain Automatic Memory Management in .NET.</H2>
                  <P>Answer:</P>
                  <P>Automatic memory management in .Net is through garbage 
                  collector which is 												incredibly efficient in 
                  releasing resources when no longer in use.</P>

                        of Hidden fields<BR><BR>Hidden fields are simple and 
                        easy to implement.<BR>Hidden fields work with Web Farms 
                        as data is cached on client side<BR>Good news is that 
                        all browsers support hidden field.<BR>And yet another 
                        advantage is that no server resources are required for 
                        Hidden fields usage<BR><BR>Limitations of Hidden field 
                        <BR><BR>One of the biggest threat of using Hidden fields 
                        are that they can be tampered creating a security 
                        hole.<BR>Page performance adversely affected if you 
                        store large data since the data are stored in pages 
                        itself.<BR>They do not support rich structures as HTML 
                        hidden fields are only single<BR>valued.<BR><BR><BR>
